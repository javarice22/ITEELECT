<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
Culturally Arts Collective, an international serving nonprofit organization, works for tangible reform for arts accessibility and representation through education, exhibition, outreach, and professional development. 
CAC also partners with museums and galleries internationally to create virtual 360-degree 3-D galleries of collections and gallery spaces, increasing global reach. We optimize a gallery for your webspace and feature it in our renown Milostka Center for Exhibitions.
We work to cultivate a culture of artistic innovation upholding the academic integrity of the arts, uplifting contemporary expression, and challenging the status quo..</p>

<h1>OUR VISION</h1>
Our Commitment to Art as Visual Activism
Art is for everyone, and by everyone. Every exhibition season, our curatorial activism program features an exhibition with a social justice theme, highlighting creatives and stories historically marginalized from the arts. Past exhibits included themes of women's rights, climate justice, Native American history, and more. 
Representation Culturally advocates for the inclusion of people from every corner and background of the world, regardless of circumstances or socioeconomic means. Accessibility As a community of artists, it is important to surround ourselves with people of similar interests as well as FREE and easily accessible opportunities to perfect and present our craft.
Outreach Culturallyâ€™s goal is to assist artists in building a network globally and for users to share their newfound talents and skills with others. We strive to foster art as community activation and visual activism through the arts for social change on a global scale.
